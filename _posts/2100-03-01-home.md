I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in [Materials Science & Engineering](http://www.mse.engin.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.  I also completed my undergraduate degree in [Materials Science](http://matsci.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University.  

Currently, my research interests lay in the field of computational materials science.  In addition to being familiar with [VASP](https://www.vasp.at/), I am also involved with code development using C++.
